     <h2><strong>Applications and Implications</strong></h1>
    
        <p>
Assignment: 
Propose a final project that integrates the range of units covered. <br><br>
        <h3>// What will it do?</h3>
        The final project I have in mind is a Breathing Pod, an device based on experimentations on soft robotics and environmental data detection. Indeed, the Breathing Pod will deploy soft robotics actuators in silycon to visually and physically describe a specific data detection by an environmental sensor for Carbon Dioxide.<br><br> If soft robotics has been quite largely investigated in the last 3 years and many "families" of soft actuators have been designed, their use in design and visual art field has not yet provided a concrete production. I'd like to produce a home object, a sort of companion, able to monitor the quality of air at home, and modifing its life-like behaviour (its breath rithm) according to the air quality detected. <br><br>
      
            
<h3>// Who's done what beforehand?</h3>
        I followed with a lot of interest the design experiments realized by Bartlett University and ETH Architecture Department and of course the work of OtherLab by Pneubotics and Harward Biodesign department that has developed the Soft Robotics Toolkit that is the most important resource for learning about the state of the art of Soft Robotics. <br><br>

<h3>// What materials and components will be required? </h3>
        Basically, it will be done by a layered light structure in plywood in which a set of silycon soft actuators will be hanged. A further development will deploy acrylic sheets. For the pneumatics actuators, it is necessary to combine different rubbers, basically extra soft silycons, silycon epoxi glue and silycon pigments. All these materials are amazing but also quite complex and very expensive, unfortunately. So, I can't really experiment with them without a proper funding. I can count on the knowledge acquired by an italian bio-robotics department, <a href="http://www.sssup.it/ist_home.jsp?ID_LINK=10458">the BioRobotics Institute at Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna</a>, that researches and experiments a lot with soft actuators and fortunately they like to share part fo their achievements. <br><br>
        In term of hardware, the Breathign Pod can be inflated or using a set of big syringes controlled by a couple of stepper motors, or by a central electro pump. In any case, with one Arduino or FabKit or with an Arduino Mega I will be able to control the pump or the syringes and the sensor. A third hardware element, a wifi board called ESP8266, will send detected data to an online monitoring platform like smartcitizen.me
        
<h3>// Where will they come from?</h3><br>
        About the plywood, I rely on a local production. About the FabKit, I will produce it locally using FR1 and chinese electronics components. If I would use an Arduino I will take then an italian producted board or an american one (since the current arduino crisis). About the silycon, it will be produced by Smooth-On, an american brand. The pump will be chinese.  
        
<h3>// How much will it cost?</h3><br>
        
        I calculated that each soft actuator will have the super expensive price of 5 euros each (this is just the cost of silyconics components). So: actuators will cost 15 euros in total. The machinable wax necessary to make 3 actuators costs about 12 euros. 
    
        The FabKit costs about 14 euros, while the several wiring cables necessary I can approximately estimate them about 3 euros. The pump costs 20 euros, while the plywood would be about 4 euros. RGB LEDs will be about 5 euros while the ESP8266 is about 5 euros and the MQ7 sensor is about 7 euros. I can estimate 3 hours for milling the whole molds and 1 hour of laser cutter for the plywood structure. 8 hours will be for curing the silycons and about 6 to make the whole pod assembled and working properly.

The cost of the whole POD in terms of materials, without shipping costs, will be between 70 and 85 euros. 
        
        Adding the working time and the machine costs, the costs will rise to about 200 euros. The most expensive part remains the one related to silycon. 
        
<h3>// what parts and systems will be made?</h3><br>
        Almost everything. TO create the silycon muscles, I will mill the molds according to the 3D model I developed. The general structure will be completely in plywood and lasercut according to my own design. The microcontroller board FabKit is completely DIY (except for the components, of course). I will need a logic level converter board that I will prototype and a mos driver board that I will make. Connectors to pump will be probably 3D printed. I will buy the electronics components, wires and the ESP8266. 
<h3>// What processes will be used?</h3><br>
        3D modeling, Milling, molding and casting. "d modeling, Laser cutting, pcb milling, soldering and testing, wiring, programming. 
<h3>// What tasks need to be completed?</h3><br>
    - Casting several silycon muscles hoping to get the same result for each of them.<br>
    - Connecting the central pump with each muscle sending the same air quantity to each.<br>
    - Controlling the electro pump in order to create a bio-inspired behaviour for the soft robots. <br>
    - Understanding how to integrate electronics, boards and power supply in the general design.<br>
    - Understand how to use the ESP8266 <br>
    
<h3>how will it be evaluated?</h3><br>
    The Breathing Pod is an experiment in molding and casting and in pneumatics actuators. The goal is to create a bio-inspired device that will warn about the local quality of air by changing its behaviour. The challenge is to make this device small, hangable at the wall, and silent. What I have seen as examples in the soft robotics realm, are all devices very big, or connected to huge control console. This prototype investigate how to bring soft robotics to the consumer level.
